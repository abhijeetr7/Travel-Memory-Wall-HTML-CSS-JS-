# Travel-Memory-Wall-HTML-CSS-JS-


I've created a "Travel Memory Wall" web application, all contained within a single index.html file as requested.

This application allows you to:

Pin memories to a map: Click anywhere on the interactive (placeholder) map to select a location for your memory.

Upload photos and add details: Fill in a form with a photo, location name, country, date, a short note, and a mood emoji.

View memories in a gallery: All your added memories are displayed in a scrollable gallery.

Filter memories: Use dropdowns and an input field to filter memories by continent (simplified), country, year, or mood.

Timeline Slider: A horizontal slider allows you to filter memories by a specific year.

Persistent storage: All your memories (including photos as Base64 strings) are saved in your browser's localStorage, so they persist even if you close and reopen the tab.

Memory Details Modal: Click on any memory in the gallery or a pin on the map to view its details in a modal, and you can also delete it from there.

I've used Tailwind CSS for styling to ensure a clean, modern, and responsive design, along with the Inter font.
